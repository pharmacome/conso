HBP00234	ACY-1215	pmid:24844691	Ricolinostat is an orally bioavailable, specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) with potential antineoplastic activity.

HBP00277	entorhinal cortex layer 2	pmid:27798139	Layer of the entorhinal cortex lying superficial to layer 3 and deep to layer 1. It is characterized by medium-to large sized stellate cells that are grouped into prominent clusters, particularly in the rostral entorhinal cortex.
HBP00278	granular layer of cerebellar cortex	pmid:29221819	The granular layer is the innermost layer of the cerebellar cortex. This layer contains densely packed small neurons, mostly granule cells. Some Golgi cells are found at the outer border. Granule neurons send parallel fibers to the upper molecular layer, where they synapse with Purkinje cell dendrites. Mossy fibers from the pontine nuclei in the white matter synapse with granule cell axons, Golgi cell axons and unipolar brush interneuron axons at cerebellar glomeruli in the granule cell layer.
