CONSO00234	0000-0001-9661-5277	ACY-1215	chemical	pubmed:24844691	Ricolinostat is an orally bioavailable, specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) with potential antineoplastic activity. Ricolinostat selectively targets and binds to HDAC6, thereby disrupting the Hsp90 protein chaperone system through hyperacetylation of Hsp90 and preventing the subsequent aggresomal protein degradation. This leads to an accumulation of unfolded and misfolded ubiquitinated proteins and may eventually induce cancer cell apoptosis, and inhibition of cancer cell growth. HDAC6, a class II HDAC deacetylase located in the cytoplasm, appears to play a key role in the formation and activation of the aggresomes needed for degradation of misfolded proteins. Compared to non-selective HDAC inhibitor, ACY-1215 is able to reduce the toxic effects on normal, healthy cells.

It modifies the target protein's cysteine residues via a stable sulfide bond through the NO group of the guanine base, in a post translational modification also known as S-guanylation, a process involved in the regulation of the physiological roles of several important proteins. The S-guanylation of tau was shown to block the aggregation process and the subsequent formation of tau oligomers.
